      <p>Hey YC! Weâ€™re <strong>Gather</strong>, a social app that augments your real life rather than replacing it. The world doesn't need another social network. We need utility apps that simplify the problems we already have, rather than creating new ones. Gather makes group planning a breeze, so you can put your phone away and get back to your friends.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>We think YC and Gather would be an awesome fit.</strong>

        <p>Gather lets you quickly create an on-demand micro social network when it's time to make plans. Gather can be used to quickly see who can come tonight, or plan an entire camping trip. One simple question or 15 related ones; Gather easily scales to any complexity while staying simple.</p>

        <p>Gather isn't done when the decision is made. After everyone works together to pick the perfect restaurant, you can book it using OpenTable. Or, when the group settles on a movie, buy tickets right from Fandango. The reservations or tickets will be sent to everyone's phone.</p>

        <p>Group planning is one of those annoying things that everyone has to deal with when they want to hang out. Our goal with Gather is to mimic how you already make plans, but with the added bonuses technology can provide.</p>

          <h2 class="meta">Phase 1: <span>Growth</span></h2>
          <p>Gather is viral. Not <em>post to your Facebook wall</em> viral &mdash; actually viral. Using it means sending it to 4-5 friends, all of whom now know about it for the next time they need to plan something.</p>
          <p>The app has a crazy-low barrier to entry. Of course it's better if the user has the app installed, however all they need is a phone that can text.</p>

          <h2 class="meta">Phase 2: <span>Monetization</span></h2>
          <p>People use Gather to plan real-world activities, meaning there's an incredibly high purchasing intent. They're going to spend money, they just don't know where. Advertisers can target users they know are picking, say, a funny movie or Mexican restaurant.</p>
          <p>Additionally, most planning with Gather ends with a purchase. Close integration with sites like OpenTable and Fandango means users can make purchases from the app &mdash; and we can take a cut.</p>

          <h2 class="meta">Phase 3: <span>Our Vision</span></h2>
          <p>There's a lot of event planning apps out there. <em> A lot.</em> Most of them are content with just handling RSVPs. Our goal is to mimic how groups make plans, while getting out of the way as much as possible.</p>
